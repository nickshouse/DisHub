# GitHub Commit Discord Bot

This bot will monitor a specified GitHub repository and post the details of new commits to a specified Discord channel. It uses Discord.py for bot creation and aiohttp for asynchronous HTTP requests to the GitHub API.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- discord.py
- python-dotenv
- aiohttp

These requirements can be installed via pip:
```
pip install discord.py python-dotenv aiohttp
```

## Setup

1. Clone or download this repository.

2. Install the required packages from above.

3. Create a `.env` file in the same directory as `bot.py` and add the following lines:
```
BOT_TOKEN=your-bot-token
CHANNEL_ID=your-channel-id
REPO_URL=your-repo-url
GITHUB_TOKEN=your-github-token
```
Replace `your-bot-token` with your Discord bot token, `your-channel-id` with the ID of the Discord channel where commit updates will be sent, `your-repo-url` with the URL of the GitHub repository to monitor, and `your-github-token` with your GitHub personal access token.

4. Run `bot.py` to start the bot:
```
python bot.py
```

## Commands

- `!ratelimit`: The bot will reply with the current rate limit status of the GitHub API.

## Notes

- The bot will check the GitHub repository for new commits every minute. This frequency can be adjusted in the `@tasks.loop(minutes=1.0)` line in `bot.py`.

- Be sure not to share your `.env` file or expose it in your public GitHub repository, as it contains sensitive tokens.
